//! Mutex - mutual exclusion - similar to RefCell, but:
//! Allows only one thread to access data at any given time
//! When want access - signal to acquire mutex's lock
//! Lock keeps track of who has access to the data
//! mutex - guarding the data it holds via locking system
//!
//! Must attempt to acquire the lock before using data
//! when done with data - you must unlock the data
//! the call to lock of Mutex<T> returns a LockResult<smart pointer - MutexGuard>
//! MutexGuard implements Deref to point to inner data
//! Also has drop which releases data when MutexGuard out of scope
//!
//! Arc (Atomic rc) is similar to Rc, but SAFE in concurrent situations
//! Threadsafety(Arc) comes with a performane penalty
//!
//! Sync(can be ref from multiple threads) and Send(can be sent to a thread) Traits
//! T is Sync is &T is Send
